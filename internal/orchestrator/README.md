# internal/orchestrator

The always-on daemon core: the poll/reconcile loop, the node state machine, the
billing-model-aware teardown policy, and the SSH job dispatcher.

## Node state machine (`state.go`)

```
Provisioning -> Idle -> Busy -> Idle -> Draining -> Removing
```

- **Provisioning** — VM created, awaiting SSH readiness.
- **Idle** — ready and warm, no job assigned.
- **Busy** — a `one-job` run is in flight.
- **Draining / Removing** — teardown decided / `Destroy` issued.

`Pool` is the concurrency-safe node set. Stored nodes are copied in/out so
callers can't mutate shared state.

## Reconcile (`orchestrator.go`)

Each tick, under the single reconcile goroutine:

1. `provider.List(tag)` — ground truth. Adopt unknown instances (crash
   recovery, rebuilding billing timers from `CreatedAt`); drop vanished ones
   (Provisioning nodes are never dropped — a fresh VM may not be listed yet).
2. `WaitingJobs` — filter to jobs whose required labels this pool offers.
3. Dispatch each serviceable job to an Idle node; provision for the rest, capped
   by `MaxScale` (in-flight provisions count as `pending` so concurrent ticks
   don't over-provision).
4. Apply teardown to Idle nodes.
5. Reap zombie runners: `ListRunners` and delete any registration whose name
   carries our tag prefix but that we aren't currently running a job for (a VM
   that died after registering but before `one-job` finished). Deletion requires
   the runner to look orphaned for two consecutive ticks, closing the race
   against a freshly registered runner. This is the third reconcile source
   (Forgejo jobs + Forgejo runners + provider instances).

The reconcile loop is the **single writer of provisioning decisions**;
dispatch/teardown goroutines mutate only their own node's state.

## Teardown (`teardown.go`)

- `BillingPerSecond` — tear down after `IdleTimeout`.
- `BillingHourlyRoundUp` — tear down at the kill mark
  `created + (completedCycles+1)*BillingHour - HourMargin` (the `:55` rule with
  the 1h/5m defaults). Both `BillingHour` and `HourMargin` are configurable:
  defaults match the provider's actual hourly rounding, but operators can
  shorten `BillingHour` to reclaim idle VMs faster than the paid-hour boundary
  (the cloud still bills the whole hour — you trade the fill-the-paid-hour
  benefit for faster reclamation). E2E tests set them to seconds (e.g.
  `BillingHour=60s, HourMargin=10s` → kill at `created+50s`) to exercise idle
  teardown live without waiting an hour. Timers are **derived from `CreatedAt`
  each tick**, not stored, so they survive restarts.

## Shutdown

Jobs run under a context independent of the shutdown signal, so `Run` can choose
how to stop. With `DrainOnShutdown` (default) it stops scheduling and waits for
in-flight goroutines to finish (bounded by `DrainTimeout`, `0` = wait
indefinitely); otherwise it cancels the job context to interrupt them. With
`DestroyOnExit` it tears down all owned VMs on the way out — default leaves warm
VMs for a restarted daemon to readopt. In-flight goroutines are tracked with a
`WaitGroup` (`wg.Go`).

Idle prewarmed `one-job --wait` runners are cancelled before the drain wait.
Provisioning and readiness workers have their own cancellation contexts and are
also cancelled before draining; they have not received a job and must never
turn a routine restart into a boot/readiness-timeout wait.
Locally busy workers and runners explicitly reported busy by Forgejo retain the
ordinary drain behavior. Cancellation returns independently of the SSH close
handshake so an idle remote command cannot hold shutdown until `DrainTimeout`.

## Dispatch (`dispatch.go`)

`Dispatcher` is an interface so the orchestrator is unit-testable without real
SSH **and so the dispatch mechanism can be selected per provider**. Its methods
take both the worker's provider `id` and its network `addr`: SSH dispatch uses
`addr`, while a mechanism like docker exec uses `id`. `SSHDispatcher` connects
in-process with `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`, writes the one-shot token via stdin
(never the command line), and runs `forgejo-runner one-job ... --wait` to
completion. The composition root (`cmd/fj-bellows`) injects the dispatcher, so a
provider whose workers aren't reached over SSH supplies a different one.

Host keys are verified with **trust-on-first-use (TOFU) per-VM pinning**: fresh
per-hour VMs have no pre-known host key, so the first successful handshake to an
address records the presented key in an in-dispatcher pin store, and every later
dial to that address must present a byte-equal key (a mismatch is rejected as a
possible MITM). Different addresses are pinned independently. Residual risk: a
MITM present at the very first contact could still impersonate the VM; after
that, its identity is verified for the rest of its life.

### Worker → Forgejo path

`RunJob` opens a **reverse port-forward** on the dispatch SSH session: the
worker binds `127.0.0.1:<forgejo-port>`, and each accepted connection is relayed
to the orchestrator-side Forgejo using the orchestrator's own resolver. The
dispatch command prepends a `/etc/hosts` override (`127.0.0.1 <forgejo-host>`)
so the runner's lookup of the Forgejo hostname inside the worker lands on the
tunnel. TLS SNI sees the original hostname unchanged, so a public-CA cert
(e.g. via DNS-01) continues to validate end-to-end. This lets workers on a
public cloud reach a LAN-internal Forgejo whose hostname does not resolve from
the public internet — with no worker-side network configuration. The worker-side
hosts override is skipped for IP literals and for `localhost`. See #33.

The runner process is only half the story: each workflow step runs in a
spawned docker job container with its own network namespace and `/etc/hosts`.
`RunJob` also writes a forgejo-runner config (`runnerConfigYAML`) and passes
it via `--config /tmp/runner-cfg.yml`:

```yaml
container:
  docker_host: automount                              # always
  network: host                                       # hostname URLs only
  options: "--add-host=<forgejo-host>:127.0.0.1"      # hostname URLs only
```

- **`docker_host: automount`** bind-mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` into every
  spawned job container. Without it, forgejo-runner's default (`"-"`) finds a
  docker host for the runner process but does not mount the socket into job
  containers, so any `docker …` step fails with `no such file or directory`.
  This is also what makes `actions/setup-buildx`, image builds, and the rest
  of the DinD-shaped tooling work. The worker is single-tenant ephemeral and
  the job is treated as trusted (operator's own repos), matching every other
  CI runner stack. See #41.
- **`network: host`** makes the container's loopback the worker's loopback
  (where the tunnel listener sits); **`--add-host`** injects the hosts entry
  into every spawned container so the Forgejo hostname resolves to
  `127.0.0.1` there too. Without these, `actions/checkout` (and any other
  step that talks back to Forgejo) NXDOMAINs from inside a containerized step
  even when the runner process is on the tunnel. These two are skipped for
  IP-literal Forgejo URLs — hosts files can't redirect IPs to IPs; prefer a
  hostname. See #37.

Dependencies are interfaces (`JobSource`, `Dispatcher`, `provider.Provider`);
see [`mock`](mock) for the test doubles.
